# Workshop 
## Digital Transformation, Data and AI in the Western Balkans

###  11-13 November 2021, Skopje, North Macedonia

<br/><br/>

## Research context
European Commission Joint Research Center together with the World Bank, UN-GGIM-Europe, UN Economic Commission for Europe, and the Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje  is jointly organising a workshop to investigate how digital technologies, data and AI influence changes in our societies. Data and digital transformation are feeding AI. The ambition is for Europe to become the world-leading region for developing and deploying cutting edge, ethical and secure AI, as well as to promote a human-centric approach in the global context. It is also important for the Western Balkans region to adopt and benefit from these emerging technologies. The organisers of the workshop would like to bring together a variety of stakeholders, representing the public sector, civil society, academia and business, in order to (I) exchange good practices, (II) establish partnerships, and ultimately learn from each other. 

Particular emphasis will be put on the following aspects:
 * technological enablers of digital transformation,
 * digital data,
 * AI,
 * Innovative services and applications combining the above.
